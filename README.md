## Hi there 👋
I’m a **Computer Science student at HCMUT (Vietnam)** aiming to become an **AI Engineer**. I’m excited about building intelligent systems and taking them from **research to production**.

- **Focus areas:** Computer Vision, NLP, Generative AI  
- **I care about:** practical impact, clean design, measurable results  
- **How I work:** iterate fast, document well, automate early

## 🔬 Interests
- **Vision:** detection/segmentation, pose/keypoint pipelines, multimodal learning  
- **NLP:** text classification, sequence labeling, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
- **GenAI:** prompt engineering, fine-tuning, evaluation, safety/guardrails

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, C/C++  
- **AI/ML:** PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, OpenCV  
- **Serving & Tools:** FastAPI, ONNX, NumPy/Pandas, Jupyter  
- **Dev basics:** Git/GitHub, Docker, Linux

## 🚀 What I’m Doing Now
- Prototyping CV/NLP models and turning them into small APIs/demos  
- Studying LLM fine-tuning and lightweight deployment for edge/cloud  
- Writing notes and documenting learnings as I go

## 🤝 Open To
- Research-oriented internships, open-source contributions, and project collabs  
- Building MVPs around vision/NLP/GenAI use cases
